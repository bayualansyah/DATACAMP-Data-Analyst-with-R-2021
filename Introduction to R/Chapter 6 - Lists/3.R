# Creating a named list (2)
# 
# Being a huge movie fan (remember your job at LucasFilms), you decide to start storing information on good movies with the help of lists.
# 
# Start by creating a list for the movie "The Shining". We have already created the variables mov, act and rev in your R workspace. Feel free to check them out in the console.


# Instructions
# Complete the code in the editor to create shining_list; it contains three elements:
#   
#   moviename: a character string with the movie title (stored in mov)
#   actors: a vector with the main actors' names (stored in act)
#   reviews: a data frame that contains some reviews (stored in rev)
#   
# Do not forget to name the list components accordingly (names are moviename, actors and reviews).


# The variables mov, act and rev are available

# Finish the code to build shining_list
shining_list <- list(moviename = mov, actors = act, reviews = rev)
